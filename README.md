In this code, we establish an SFTP connection using the Renci.SshNet library, and then specify the path to the compressed folder to download and extract. We download the compressed folder to a MemoryStream, and then use the System.IO.Compression library to extract each file from the compressed folder and save it to the specified extract folder.

Note that you will need to include the Renci.SshNet and System.IO.Compression libraries in your project for this code to work.
